Simple factory class which has few security vulnerabilities. 
The purpose of the class is to create elements of type Complex 
and stores them in a container. Your task is to detect those
vulnerabilities, and implement the requirements so that it's secure.


For every behaviour which is undefined,
throw an exception with an appropriate error message.
Example:

    if(input < 0) throw "Input can't be negative";



NOTE: Don't change the class interface and the container type. 
You are allowed to add attributes and methods.

Good luck and have fun!
