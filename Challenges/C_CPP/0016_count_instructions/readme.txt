In this challenge we will pay attention to sorting algorithms.

The most commonly used is Quick sort with an avarage compelxity O(n log n)...
Aiming to get the best performence can lead to security vulnerabilities.
One of the best algorithms to cure this vulnerabilitie are Merge sort and Bubble sort. 

Given is not compeleted Bubble sort. Your task is to complete the code so 
that it sorts the array in ascending order. 


Have fun!!!

NOTE: Do NOT change the interface of sort function "void sort(std::vector<int> &list)";
      you can add additional methods if needed or change the sorting algorithm.
