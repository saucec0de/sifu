  <h1>Well Done!</h1><br>
  
  <h2>As the names of the functions <i>fibonacci</i> and <i>sum_of_squares</i> suggest, they can potentially return very large values which can overflow when added.</h2>
  <br>

  <h2>
    In addition, the two functions are modifying shared data (the file <samp>computations.txt</samp>) and the modifications can take place in any order since the order of evalutation is <b>unspecified behavior</b>. Thus, there is no guarantee that the first value written in the file will be from <i>fibonacci</i>.

  Here is your flag: {{cfg.flag}}
